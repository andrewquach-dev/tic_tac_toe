# Tic Tac Toe
This is my attempt to make Tic Tac Toe in a OOP way. It started of as a console program but it is eventually coming together as a webapp.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

The project initially started of as a console program. The program focused on taking string coordinate inputs, updating the values to the board variable and printing the board entirely in string onto the console. I then gradually shifted the methods and properties to take into consideration of click events. 

## Optimizations

The robot AI is very inefficent and slow and I can definitely see it blocking the program. I defnitely want to focus on creating a revamped and robust version of the robot mode.

The design is super basic because I wanted to focus on the javascript. I'd like to do a better job stylizing the page. 

## Lessons Learned:

The goal of this project is to solidify what I learned about OOP at the time and I feel like I met that goal. I was able to actually use encapuslation to put my tic tac toe related methods and properties into a single object and used abstraction to only show the essentials to the outside while hiding details.
